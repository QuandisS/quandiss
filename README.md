## About Me

I am passionate about development and strive to learn new skills and apply them in my work on a regular basis. I am not intimidated by challenging tasks and am able to reach compromises when necessary. I have a talent for finding common ground with team members and attempt to infuse formal communication with a touch of humor and humanity.

Additionally, I enjoy music and play the guitar, and in the past, I have been professionally involved in hockey.
